realtime version of Battleship created with meteor.js

# Synopsis
This repository contains the package of the game battleship. This version is a 1p game. And is played by typing coords in the input field at the right bottom.

# Installation
for installation check the docs of meteor.js <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/quickstart" target="_blank">Here</a>

# Motivation
My motivation to make this game was to get to know more about OOP javaScript.
This game is made with the framework Meteor.js. That's because i want to know more about this framework aswell.

# Development
First i created the game only with OOP. This was because i was more known by this type of programming unlike the framework Meteor.js. When this was done i was trying to add the framework in the code.
on second thought i should have use meteor at the start, cause i thought this was more difficult.
